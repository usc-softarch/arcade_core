# Are you using ARCADE? Please let us know!

We'd love to know more about the project you use ARCADE for. This information allows us to apply for more funding that can support future development and maintenance of ARCADE. Feel free to contact either [Nenad Medvidović](mailto:neno@usc.edu) or [Joshua Garcia](mailto:joshug4@uci.edu) to let us know more about how you use ARCADE.

# What is ARCADE?

Architecture Recovery, Change, And Decay Evaluator (ARCADE) is a software workbench that employs (1) a suite of architecture-recovery techniques, (2) a catalogue of architectural smell definitions, (3) accompanying smell-detection algorithms, and (4) a set of metrics for measuring different aspects of architectural change and decay. ARCADE combines these elements to investigate a variety of questions regarding architectural change and decay.

ARCADE’s foundational element is its suite of architecture-recovery techniques. The architectures produced by the Recovery Techniques are used for studying change and decay. ARCADE currently provides access to eight recovery techniques. This allows an engineer to (1) extract
multiple architectural views and to (2) ensure maximum accuracy of extracted architectures by highlighting their different aspects.

# Is there an ARCADE  manual?

There sure is. You can find it [here](https://tiny.cc/arcademanual).

# Where is the rest of ARCADE?

ARCADE is split into a repo for Java elements and another for Python elements. You can find the repo with the core Java elements [here](https://bitbucket.org/joshuaga/arcade) and the repo with the Python elements [here](https://bitbucket.org/joshuaga/arcadepy).
